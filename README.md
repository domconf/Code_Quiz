# Code_Quiz

## Description

The goal of this application was to design a quiz using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Upon pressing the "Start Quiz" button, a user will see an information box stating the instructions for the quiz. Once the information is understood, the user can click the "Continue" button to begin the quiz and get as many questions correct in the alotted 60 seconds. It is important to note that every incorrect answer will deduct 10 seconds from the timer on the quiz. Once the time runs out or all of the questions are answered, the user will be able to see their score based on how they did on the quiz. The user is then able to log their initials into an input box that will display on the leaderboard where they will be able to see how they rank against their peers.
